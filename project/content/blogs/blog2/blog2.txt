Nietzsche's key ideas include the Apollonian/Dionysian dichotomy,
perspectivism, the Will to Power, the "death of God", the Übermensch
and eternal recurrence. One of the key tenets of his philosophy is
the concept of "life-affirmation," which embraces the realities of
the world in which we live over the idea of a world beyond.
