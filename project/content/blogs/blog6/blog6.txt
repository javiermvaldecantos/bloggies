William of Ockham (also Occam; c. 1287 – 1347) was an English Franciscan
friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian, who is believed to have
been born in Ockham, a small village in Surrey.[1] He is considered to
be one of the major figures of medieval thought and was at the centre of
the major intellectual and political controversies of the fourteenth
century.
