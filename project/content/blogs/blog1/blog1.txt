Arthur Schopenhauer (German: ['a?t?? '??p?n?ha???]; 22 February 1788 – 21 September 1860)
was a German philosopher best known for his book, The World as Will and Representation
(German: Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung), in which he claimed that our world
is driven by a continually dissatisfied will, continually seeking satisfaction.

Influenced by Eastern philosophy, he maintained that the "truth was recognized
by the sages of India";[2] consequently, his solutions to suffering were similar to those
of Vedantic and Buddhist thinkers (e.g., asceticism). The influence of "transcendental
ideality"[3] led him to choose atheism.[4][5][6][7]
