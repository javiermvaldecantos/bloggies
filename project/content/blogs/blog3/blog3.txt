Kant's major work, the Critique of Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen
Vernunft, 1781),[2] aimed to explain the relationship between reason
and human experience. With this project, he hoped to move beyond what
he took to be failures of traditional philosophy and metaphysics.

He attempted to put an end to what he considered an era of futile and
speculative theories of human experience, while resisting the skepticism
of thinkers such as David Hume.
