René Descartes (Latinized: Renatus Cartesius; 31 March 1596 – 11 February 1650)
was a French philosopher, mathematician and writer who spent most of his
life in the Dutch Republic.

He has been dubbed the father of modern philosophy, and much subsequent
Western philosophy is a response to his writings,[7][8] which are studied
closely to this day.
